Cosmic Visualization
A visually engaging Solar System simulation built with HTML and CSS. This project presents an animated view of the solar system with the Sun at the center, surrounded by orbiting planets. Each planet follows its own orbital path, illustrating planetary motion and distance relationships in a simplified form.


Project Overview
The Cosmic Visualization project provides an interactive, animated representation of the planets orbiting the Sun. Each planet has its unique orbit size and speed, simulating a simplified view of our solar system.

Features
Realistic Orbits: Each planet orbits the Sun in a circular path with a unique radius and speed, giving a sense of the actual solar system’s layout.
Planetary Representation: All eight planets are visually represented with distinct images and sizes, orbiting in a continuous animation.
Dynamic Background: A galaxy-themed background enhances the simulation’s immersive feel.
Fully Responsive: Adjusts to various screen sizes for consistent viewing on different devices.
Technologies Used
HTML & CSS: For structure and styling of the planets, orbits, and background.
CSS Animations: Used to animate the rotation of planets along their orbital paths.
