Cosmic Visualization:
A visually engaging Solar System simulation built with HTML and CSS. This project presents an animated view of the solar system with the Sun at the center, surrounded by orbiting planets. Each planet follows its own orbital path, illustrating planetary motion and distance relationships in a simplified form.


Project Overview:
The Cosmic Visualization project provides an interactive, animated representation of the planets orbiting the Sun. Each planet has its unique orbit size and speed, simulating a simplified view of our solar system.

Features:
Realistic Orbits: Each planet orbits the Sun in a circular path with a unique radius and speed, giving a sense of the actual solar system’s layout.
Planetary Representation: All eight planets are visually represented with distinct images and sizes, orbiting in a continuous animation.
Dynamic Background: A galaxy-themed background enhances the simulation’s immersive feel.

Technologies Used:

HTML & CSS: For structure and styling of the planets, orbits, and background.
CSS Animations: Used to animate the rotation of planets along their orbital paths.

Project Structure:
index.html: Contains the HTML structure for the solar system layout.
project.css: Contains all CSS styling, including the animations for orbits and planets.
assets/: Directory with images for the planets, Sun, and background.

Usage:
This visualization is suitable for educational purposes or as an artistic project to understand the basics of CSS animations and how they can create dynamic visuals.

Future Enhancements:
Add interactivity to control orbit speeds or zoom in/out on planets.
Display information on each planet when hovered over or clicked.
Enhance visual details like adding moon animations for planets.
